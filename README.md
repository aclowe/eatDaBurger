## Instructions:
- To add a burger, enter the name of the burger in the form within the "Add a Burger" div, then click "Add Burger!".
- The burger will save to the MySQL database and appear in the "Uneaten Burgers" div.
- A "DEVOUR!" button will appear next to each burger in the "Uneaten Burgers" div.
- To eat the burger, click the "DEVOUR!" button. Within the MySQL database, this will change the value of "devour" from "false" to "true" for the chosen burger.
- The burger will then move to the "Eaten Burgers" div in HTML.
